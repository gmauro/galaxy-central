**Auto-detect**

The system can detect FASTA, MAF, Wiggle, BED and Interval (BED with headers) formats. Other formats will be set to generic text files. If your file is not detected properly as one of the known formats it most likely means that it might have some format problems for example: different number of columns on different rows. You can still coerce the system to set your data to the format you think is should be (please send us a note if you see a case when a valid format is not detected).

**BED**

* Tab delimited format
* Does not require header line
* Contains 3 required fields:

  - chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or contig (e.g. ctgY1).
  - chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
  - chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.

* May contain 9 additional optional BED fields:

  - name - Defines the name of the BED line. This label is displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser window when the track is open to full display mode or directly to the left of the item in pack mode.
  - score - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray).
  - strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
  - thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays).
  - thickEnd - The ending position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the stop codon in gene displays).
  - itemRgb - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the track line itemRgb attribute is set to "On", this RBG value will determine the display color of the data contained in this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme (eight colors or less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming the color resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser.
  - blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line.
  - blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
  - blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.

* Example::

    chr22 1000 5000 cloneA 960 + 1000 5000 0 2 567,488, 0,3512
    chr22 2000 6000 cloneB 900 - 2000 6000 0 2 433,399, 0,3601

**Genomic Intervals**

- Tab delimited format
- File must start with definition line in the following format (columns may be in any order).::

    #CHROM START END STRAND

- CHROM - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or contig (e.g. ctgY1).
- START - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
- END - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.
- STRAND - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
- Example::

    #CHROM START END   STRAND NAME COMMENT
    chr1   10    100   +      exon myExon
    chrX   1000  10050 -      gene myGene

-----

**FASTA**

Fasta file may contain any number of sequences. Each sequence starts with a definition line identified by &gt; symbol::

    >sequence1
    atgcgtttgcgtgc
    gtcggtttcgttgc
    >sequence2
    tttcgtgcgtatag
    tggcgcggtga

-----

**MAF**

TBA and multiz multiple alignment format

-----

**AXT**

blastz pairwise alignment format

-----

**Tab delimited**

Any data in tab delimited format

-----

**Other text type**

Any text file
