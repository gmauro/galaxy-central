**Warning**

This code will count reads overlapping contigs supplied in the bed file using bedtools_ multibamcov

If the bed file contains a name field in column 4, it will be used as the contig name.
Otherwise, a contig name will be constructed using chr:start-end
Please note that the counts for each contig will be reported - so if you have duplicates, they will be amalgamated into a single row.
To prevent this from happening, supply a unique contig name as the 4th column of your bed file

**Note**

bams2mx is an experimental tool currently under test

There is much discussion about whether to count optical/pcr duplicates. If you set the ignore flag to True, any reads in the input BAM files marked as
duplicates by upstream processing such as the Picard MarkDuplicates tool will NOT be counted. The 'right' setting depends on your data and coverage. For extremely deep 
coverage, true duplicate reads are inevitable and ignoring them may be throwing away useful real data. In most cases, counting them is probably a reasonable
choice - any induced bias is likely to be non-differential between samples, whereas it's not at all clear whether that's the case if they are ignored.

**What this tool does**

This tool takes a file containing a set of genomic regions of interest in BED format, a window size and an arbitrary
number of BAM files containing aligned sequences.

For each region in the BED file, it extends the start and end coordinates by the window size (so total length is
region + 2*windowsize), then counts and reports the number of sequences overlapping in each BED file

Optical and/or PCR duplicates marked with the is_duplicate flag in the bam files will be ignored when counting if the
ignore duplicates option is selected (default) 

The output is a tabular file containing the count matrix and suitable for downstream processing.
