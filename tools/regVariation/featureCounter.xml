**What it does**

This tool finds the coverage of intervals in the first query on intervals in the second query. The count and coverage are added as 3 new columns, as explained in the example below.

-----

**Example**


- if **First query** consists of following windows::

      chrX 1     10001 seg 0 -
      chrX 10001 20001 seg 0 -
      chrX 20001 30001 seg 0 -
      chrX 30001 40001 seg 0 -
      
- and **Second query** consits of following exons::

      chrX 5000  6000  seg2 0 -
      chrX 5500  7000  seg2 0 -
      chrX 9000  22000 seg2 0 -
      chrX 24000 34000 seg2 0 -
      chrX 36000 38000 seg2 0 -
      
- the **Result** is the coverage of exons of second query in each of the windows contained in first query::

	  chrX 1     10001 seg 0 - 2 1 30.01
   	  chrX 10001 20001 seg 0 - 1 0 100.00
	  chrX 20001 30001 seg 0 - 0 2 80.00
	  chrX 30001 40001 seg 0 - 1 1 59.99
	  
- For example, the following line of output (New columns added are indexed by a-d below)::

   chrX 1     10001 seg 0 - 2 1 30.01
                            a b   c   
                                  
   implies that 2 exons(a) fall in this window(chrX:1-10001) and 1 exon(b) partially overlaps with this window, and these 3 exons cover 30% of the window size(c).

	 a : Number of features in the 2nd query that fall COMPLETELY within this window
	 b : Number of features in the 2nd query that partially overlap with this window
	 c : % of window size covered by features in 'a' and 'b' (Features overlapping with eachother will be merged to calculate 'c')
