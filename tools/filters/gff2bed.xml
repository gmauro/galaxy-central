**Syntax**

This tool converts a GFF format file to BED format.

- **GFF format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes and other features associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences. GFF lines have nine tab-separated fields::

    1. seqname - Must be a chromosome or scaffold.
    2. source - The program that generated this feature.
    3. feature - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "CDS", "start_codon", "stop_codon", and "exon".
    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.
    5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
    7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).
    8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
    9. group - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

- **BED format** Browser Extensible Data format was designed at UCSC for displaying data tracks in the Genome Browser. It has three required fields and twelve additional optional ones:: 

    The first three BED fields (required) are:
    1. chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr1, chrY_random).
    2. chromStart - The starting position in the chromosome. (The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.)
    3. chromEnd - The ending position in the chromosome, plus 1 (i.e., a half-open interval). 

    The twelve additional BED fields (optional) are:
    4. name - The name of the BED line.
    5. score - A score between 0 and 1000.
    6. strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
    7. thickStart - The starting position where the feature is drawn thickly at the Genome Browser.
    8. thickEnd - The ending position where the feature is drawn thickly at the Genome Browser.
    9. reserved - This should always be set to zero.
   10. blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line.
   11. blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
   12. blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
   13. expCount - The number of experiments.
   14. expIds - A comma-separated list of experiment ids. The number of items in this list should correspond to expCount.
   15. expScores - A comma-separated list of experiment scores. All of the expScores should be relative to expIds. The number of items in this list should correspond to expCount.

**Example**

- GFF format::

    chr22  TeleGene	enhancer  10000000  10001000  500	+  .  TG1
    chr22  TeleGene	promoter  10010000  10010100  900	+  .  TG1
    chr22  TeleGene	promoter  10020000  10025000  800	-  .  TG2

- Convert the above file to BED format::

    chr22   9999999         10001000        enhancer        0       +
    chr22   10009999        10010100        promoter        0       +
    chr22   10019999        10025000        promoter        0       -
