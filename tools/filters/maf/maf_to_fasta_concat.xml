**Syntax**

This tool converts a MAF formated file to the FASTA format, and concatenates the results in the same organism.

- **MAF format** multiple alignment format file. This format stores multiple alignments at the DNA level between entire genomes.

  - The .maf format is line-oriented. Each multiple alignment ends with a blank line.
  - Each sequence in an alignment is on a single line.
  - Lines starting with # are considered to be comments.
  - Each multiple alignment is in a separate paragraph that begins with an "a" line and contains an "s" line for each sequence in the multiple alignment.
  - Some MAF files may contain two optional line types:

    - An "i" line containing information about what is in the aligned species DNA before and after the immediately preceding "s" line;
    - An "e" line containing information about the size of the gap between the alignments that span the current block.

- **FASTA format** a text-based format for representing both nucleic and protein sequences, in which base pairs or proteins are represented using a single-letter code.

  - This format contains a one line header. It starts with a " >" symbol. The first word on this line is the name of the sequence. The rest of the line is a description of the sequence.
  - The remaining lines contain the sequence itself.
  - Blank lines in a FASTA file are ignored, and so are spaces or other gap symbols (dashes, underscores, periods) in a sequence.
  - Fasta files containing multiple sequences are just the same, with one sequence listed right after another. This format is accepted for many multiple sequence alignment programs.

**Example**

- MAF format::

    ##maf version=1 scoring=multiz.v7
    # multiz.v7 R=10 M=0 /cluster/bluearc/hg17/multiz.2004-07-13/danRer1/chrY.maf /cluster/bluearc/hg17/multiz.2004-07-13/panTro1mm5rn3canFam1galGal2fr1/chrY.maf -

    a score=236.0
    s hg17.chrY          3757 13 +  57701691 GATCCACTGTTCC
    s galGal2.chrUn 101379810 13 + 165033910 GCCCCGCTCACCC

    a score=418.0
    s hg17.chrY          3770 3 +  57701691 TGT
    s galGal2.chrUn 101379823 3 + 165033910 TTT
    s danRer1.chrUn 354601716 3 + 367113659 TGT

- Converts the hg17 in the above file to concatenated FASTA format::

    &gt;hg17
    GATCCACTGTTCCTGT
