<h2>Known Bugs in Gmaj</h2>
<p class=vvlarge>
The following anomalies in Gmaj's display and behavior have been
observed, but not yet resolved.  Some of these are intermittent,
and some may depend on your platform and/or version of Java.
<p>
If you experience any of these (or similar) problems, it may help
to switch to a different version of Java.  For example, the first
bug listed below (phantom repeats) seems to have been introduced
with Sun's J2SE 1.4.x series, so you may be better off with 1.3.x
or 1.5.x.  You can also try switching to a different vendor's
implementation, but then you are on your own, as we develop and
test Gmaj using Sun's official API and SDK.  Currently Gmaj does
not rely on any features beyond Java 1.3, in order to preserve
version flexibility for our users.
<p>
Note that anomalies that depend on the Java version could be due
to bugs in Java itself, but could also be bugs in Gmaj that only
"matter" with certain implementations of Java.  In either case,
however, with further investigation it may be possible to work
around the problem in future releases of Gmaj.
<p class=vlarge>
<ul>
<li>	<i>Phantom repeats.</i>&nbsp;
	After zooming in on a small region, the "repeats" panel
	sometimes shows a spurious extra bar superimposed on the
	legitimate features across the entire width of the window,
	or the features may disappear entirely.
<p>
<li>	<i>Missing zoom box and crosshairs.</i>&nbsp;
	With some datasets (large ones especially) the lines for the
	zoom rectangle and crosshairs may not display.  It still
	zooms OK though, if you just pretend the lines are there.
	<b>Update:</b> This appears to have been fixed in Java 1.5.
<p>
<li>	<i>Scrollbar obscures block buttons.</i>&nbsp;
	If there is not enough room for all of the block buttons
	corresponding to the marked position, a scrollbar will
	appear.  However, the extra vertical space required for
	the scrollbar may not be calculated properly, so that the
	scrollbar partially obscures the button labels.  To read
	the labels, drag the partition between the mark indicator
	box and the button panel toward the left, to create more
	space for the buttons.
<p>
<li>	<i>Can't copy text from dialog messages in applet.</i>&nbsp;
	In applet mode, you may not be able to select and copy text
	from pop-up message boxes to the system clipboard for
	pasting elsewhere.  This is apparently due to a bug in Java;
	hopefully Sun will fix it eventually.

If you encounter any bugs not listed here, please report them to
<img align=top alt="[image of email address]" src="cathy.gmaj.png">.
It would be helpful if you can include the version of Gmaj you
are using (i.e., the JarDate line from the Help - About message),
your computer platform and version of Java, copies of the data
files you were trying to view, and a description of exactly what
you were doing when the problem occurred.  This will help us to
reproduce the problem so we can track it down and fix it.
Non-bug suggestions and feedback are also welcome.
<p>
Thank you for using Gmaj, and helping us to make it better.
