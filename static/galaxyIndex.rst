Welcome to Galaxy
=================

Galaxy is a web-based data analysis framework for comparative genomics. It exists in two flavors:

* `Galaxy2`__ - features genomic datasets and allows various operations on genomic coordinates
* `Galaxy1`__ - the old version that is still maintained but not actively developed

Galaxy aims to be a zero configuration entirely self contained system, that provides a lightweight webserver, an embedded database and a multi-threaded job manager. Tools (and their parameters) can be specified via simple XML based configuration files. Galaxy allows you to deploy a wide variety of bioinformatics tools through the web. It renders all HTML widgets the tools need, verifies inputs, and stores and manages the outputs that these tools create.
